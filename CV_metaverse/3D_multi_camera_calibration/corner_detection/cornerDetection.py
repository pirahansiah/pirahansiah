# This function use several methods for preprocessing and postprocessing images for better recognition calibration pattern.
# The pre build function of chessboard detection in OpenCV failed to recognize some calibration patterns

    # - cornerDetection.ipynb
        
    #     - It use several preprocessing and postprocessing steps to enhance corner detection use by camera calibration.

    #     - 3D multi camera calibration require detect and set points for all camera together  

    #     - if the calibration pattern images are not good, blur, ... it need to enhance it first then use corner points to detect and use for calibration process
