### Computer Vision, Deep Learning, AI `Metaverse`

I have 6+ years of experience as a computer vision research engineer in three multinational companies in two continents, strengthened by my academic background with a Masterâ€™s and PhD in Computer Science (Computer Vision). My expertise includes Technical Lead R&D, Software Specialists Image Processing - Medical Devices, Computer Vision with Machine Learning (Object Detection, Video Tracking), IoT, and Robotics; and I am experienced in designing algorithms for Image Thresholding, Optical Flow, Camera Calibration, and Stereo Vision. Lastly, I have a track record in creating effective metrics, building end-to-end pipelines, and writing production-level codes with OpenCV and Deep Learning frameworks (Caffe, TensorFlow, PyTorch).

The first step for camera calibration is corner detection. Based on my research, the calibration pattern image play important rule in the whole calibration process.

        - It use several preprocessing and postprocessing steps to enhance corner detection use by camera calibration.

        - 3D multi camera calibration require detect and set points for all camera together  

        - if the calibration pattern images are not good, blur, ... it need to enhance it first then use corner points to detect and use for calibration process
